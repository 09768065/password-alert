Password Alert
====================

Password Alert helps protect against phishing attacks. If you enter your Google for Work password into anywhere other than accounts.google.com, you’ll receive an alert, so you can change your password if needed. Password Alert works like a spellchecker, comparing your keystrokes within the Chrome browser to your password to help you avoid mistakes. It doesn’t store your password or actual keystrokes, or send either to any remote system beyond your computer -- instead, it locally saves a fingerprint of your password, and compares that fingerprint to the fingerprint of what you’re typing.

Separately, Password Alert also tries to detect fake Google login pages to alert you before you’ve typed in your password. To do so, Password Alert checks the HTML of each page you visit to ascertain whether it appears to be impersonating a Google login page.

The Chrome extension is only intended for Google for Work accounts; other account passwords are not affected because the extension only compares your keystrokes to the stored fingerprint of your Google account password. The extension also does not operate in Incognito windows. When Google for Work administrators deploy Password Alert across all Chrome clients in their domains, the administrators can receive alerts when Password Alert triggers.
