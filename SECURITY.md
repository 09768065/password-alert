## Data is kept locally
Password hashes are kept locally and never sent anywhere. A 37-bit, salted SHA-1 of the password is kept in localStorage.

## Extension Isolation
The extension's code and localStorage is isolated from the pages you visit. This means there's no cross-site data access from a malicious website to the content script or the background page. More details are available here: https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/content_scripts#execution-environment

## Brute-forcing the password from a malicious webpage
One attack idea is for a malicious page to generate fake keystrokes and then watch for the warning banner to appear. We have three protections in place to deter this:

1. We discard keyboardEvents that appear to be generated by JavaScript on the page instead of a real user typing. For example, in [chrome/content_script.js](chrome/content_script.js) passwordalert.handleKeypress_() see the checks for .view and .timeStamp.

2. The background page limits password checks to a somewhat human speed. Anything over the limit is silently discarded. For the code, see [chrome/background.js](chrome/background.js) passwordalert.background.checkRateLimit_()

3. Saving only 37 bits of the hash intentionally creates collisions. A straight-forward brute force of the hash would result in 10 million+ collisions for a 10 character password, depending on your character space. An attacker would need to pick out the correct password from this list. The value 37 bits was chosen to be rare enough that the collisions would essentially never happen during normal typing, but common enough to cause collisions in brute-forcing. Normal typing would cause a false positive approximately every 10k+ years of regular typing.

## Google's bug bounty program
Password Alert is covered by Google's bug bounty program as
described here: https://www.google.com/about/appsecurity/reward-program/

For Password Alert specifically, vulnerabilities that would be
in-scope for the bug bounty program would be things such as:
- unauthenticated access to user data on the server
- a way for a malicious web page to get the password hash from the
Chrome Extension
- code execution in the context of the Chrome Extension's background
page or the isolated content script.

However one thing comes to mind that would likely *not* be in-scope
for the bug bounty program: Ways for phishing sites to evade detection
by the Chrome Extension, such as by obfuscating their HTML to avoid
the string matching, or sending spurious events to avoid triggering
password typing alerts. We expect evasion to be a cat-and-mouse game
and we plan on dealing with evasion techniques as they're used by
attackers. If attackers actually put the time in to specifically evade
the tool, then we'll consider building it into Chrome to make evasion
less feasible.
