To do so, Password Catcher checks the HTML of each page that you visit to see if it\u2019s impersonating a Google login page.\n\nFAQ\n\u2013 Does Password Catcher store my password?\nNo. Password Catcher doesn\u2019t store your password or keystrokes \u2013 instead, it uses a secure thumbnail of your password, which it compares against your recent keystrokes within Chrome to help spot the secure thumbnail on sites that might be malicious.\n\n\u2013 Where does Password Catcher send data?\nIf you are using Password Catcher in a Gmail account, Password Catcher does not send any data from your local computer. If your Google for Work administrator deploys Password Catcher across all managed Chrome browsers in your domain, the administrator will receive alerts when Password Catcher triggers.\n\n\u2013 What are Password Catcher\u2019s limits?\nPassword Catcher does not protect incognito windows, Chrome Apps or Chrome Extensions. Nor does it protect passwords for non-Google services. Password Catcher only operates inside the Chrome web browser when Javascript is enabled.\n"},"extension_name":{"message":"Password Catcher"},"ignore":{"message":"Ignore"},"initialization_message":{"message":"For Password Catcher to take effect, please sign in to your account."},"initialization_thank_you_message":{"message":"Thank you.
