To do so, Password Alert checks the HTML of each page you visit to see if it\u2019s impersonating a Google login page.\n\nFAQ\n-- When will Password Alert take effect?\nPassword Alert will initialize itself the next time you enter your password into accounts.google.com.\n\n-- Does Password Alert store my password or keystrokes?\nNo. Password Alert doesn\u2019t store your password or keystrokes -- instead, it stores a secure thumbnail of your password, which it compares against a thumbnail of your most recent keystrokes within Chrome.\n\n-- Where does Password Alert send data?\nIf you are using Password Alert in a Gmail account, Password Alert does not send any data from your local computer. If your Google for Work administrator chooses to deploy Password Alert across your domain, the administrator will receive alerts when Password Alert triggers.\n\n-- What are Password Alert's limits?\nPassword Alert doesn't protect incognito windows, Chrome Apps, or Chrome Extensions. It also does not protect passwords for non-Google services. Password Alert only operates inside the Chrome web browser when Javascript is enabled.\n\n-- Where can I find more details?\nVisit the full FAQ at LINK_TBD, or you can see the entire open-source codebase at https://github.com/google/password-alert\n\nBy installing this item, you agree to the Google Terms of Service and Privacy Policy at www.google.com/policies/\n"},"extension_name":{"message":"Password Alert"},"ignore":{"message":"Ignore this time"},"initialization_message":{"message":"For Password Alert to take effect, please sign in to your account."},"initialization_thank_you_message":{"message":"Thank you.
