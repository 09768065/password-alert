To do so, Password Catcher checks the HTML of each page you visit to see if it\u2019s impersonating a Google login page.\n\nFAQ\n-- When will Password Catcher take effect?\nPassword Catcher will initialize itself the next time you enter your password into accounts.google.com.\n\n-- Does Password Catcher store my password or keystrokes?\nNo. Password Catcher doesn\u2019t store your password or keystrokes -- instead, it stores a secure thumbnail of your password, which it compares against a thumbnail of your most recent keystrokes within Chrome.\n\n-- Where does Password Catcher send data?\nIf you are using Password Catcher in a Gmail account, Password Catcher does not send any data from your local computer. If your Google for Work administrator chooses to deploy Password Catcher across your domain, the administrator will receive alerts when Password Catcher triggers.\n\n-- What are Password Catcher's limits?\nPassword Catcher doesn't protect incognito windows, Chrome Apps, or Chrome Extensions. It also does not protect passwords for non-Google services. Password Catcher only operates inside the Chrome web browser when Javascript is enabled.\n\n-- Where can I find more details?\nVisit the full FAQ at LINK_TBD, or you can see the entire open-source codebase at https://github.com/google/password- catcher.\n\nBy installing this item, you agree to the Google Terms of Service and Privacy Policy at www.google.com/policies/\n"},"extension_name":{"message":"\u12e8\u12ed\u1208\u134d \u1243\u120d \u1218\u12eb\u12e3"},"ignore":{"message":"Ignore this time"},"initialization_message":{"message":"\u12e8\u12ed\u1208\u134d \u1243\u120d \u1218\u12eb\u12e3 \u1270\u130d\u1263\u122b\u12ca \u12a5\u1295\u12f2\u1206\u1295 \u12a5\u1263\u12ad\u12ce \u12c8\u12f0 \u1218\u1208\u12eb\u12ce \u12ed\u130d\u1261\u1362"},"initialization_thank_you_message":{"message":"\u12a5\u1293\u1218\u1230\u130d\u1293\u1208\u1295\u1362 \u12e8\u12ed\u1208\u134d \u1243\u120d \u1218\u12eb\u12e3 \u12a0\u1201\u1295 \u1270\u130d\u1263\u122b\u12ca \u1206\u1297\u120d\u1362"},"password_warning_banner_body":{"message":"\u12e8\u12a5\u122d\u1235\u12ce \u12e8Gmail \u12ed\u1208\u134d \u1243\u120d \u12a0\u1201\u1295 \u12e8Gmail \u120b\u120d\u1206\u1290 \u1218\u130d\u1262\u12eb \u1308\u133d \u1270\u130b\u120d\u1327\u120d\u1362 \u12e8Gmail \u1218\u1208\u12eb\u12ce\u1295 \u12f0\u1205\u1295\u1290\u1275 \u1208\u1218\u1320\u1260\u1245 \u12e8\u12ed\u1208\u134d \u1243\u120d\u12ce\u1295 \u12c8\u12f2\u12eb\u12cd\u1291 \u12f3\u130d\u121d \u121b\u1235\u1300\u1218\u122d \u12a0\u1208\u1265\u12ce\u1275\u1362 \u12a5\u1295\u12f2\u1201\u121d \u12a5\u1263\u12ad\u12ce \u12e8Gmail \u12ed\u1208\u134d \u1243\u120d\u12ce \u1260\u120c\u120e\u127d \u12a0\u1308\u120d\u130d\u120e\u1276\u127d \u120b\u12ed \u12f3\u130d\u121d \u1325\u1245\u121d \u120b\u12ed \u12a0\u1208\u1218\u12cb\u1209\u1295 \u12eb\u1228\u130b\u130d\u1271\u1362 -- \u12a0\u1208\u1260\u1208\u12da\u12eb \u12a8\u1218\u1208\u12eb\u12ce\u127d\u12ce \u12cd\u1235\u1325 \u12a0\u1295\u12f1 \u12a8\u1270\u1320\u1208\u1348 \u1201\u1209\u121d \u120a\u1320\u1208\u1349 \u12ed\u127d\u120b\u1209\u1362"},"password_warning_banner_header":{"message":"\u12e8Gmail \u12ed\u1208\u134d \u1243\u120d\u12ce\u1295 \u12f3\u130d\u121d \u12eb\u1235\u1300\u121d\u1229"},"phishing_warning_banner_body":{"message":"\u12ed\u1205 \u1323\u1262\u12eb \u12e8\u12ed\u1208\u134d \u1243\u120d\u12ce\u1295 \u1208\u1218\u1235\u1228\u1245 \u12e8\u1210\u1230\u1275 \u12e8\u1206\u1290 \u12e8Google \u1218\u130d\u1262\u12eb \u1308\u1339\u1295 \u1235\u122a\u1275 \u12a5\u12e8\u1270\u1320\u1240\u121d \u12eb\u1208 \u12ed\u1218\u1235\u120b\u120d\u1363 \u1235\u1208\u12da\u1205 \u1273\u130d\u12f7\u120d\u1362 \u12ed\u1205 \u1323\u1262\u12eb \u12ae\u121d\u1352\u12cd\u1270\u122d\u12ce\u1295 \u120a\u130e\u12f3 \u12a5\u1295\u12f0\u121a\u127d\u120d \u12a8\u1270\u1228\u12f1 \u1323\u1262\u12eb\u12cd\u1295 \u1218\u130e\u1265\u1298\u1275 \u12ed\u127d\u120b\u1209\u1363 \u1290\u1308\u122d \u130d\u1295 \u12a5\u1263\u12ad\u12ce \u1260\u121a\u1270\u12ed\u1261\u1275 \u1218\u1228\u1303 \u120b\u12ed \u12ed\u1320\u1295\u1240\u1241\u1362"},"phishing_warning_banner_header":{"message":"\u12ed\u1205 \u1323\u1262\u12eb \u1273\u130d\u12f7\u120d\u1362"},"report_phishing":{"message":"Report This Site"},"reset_password":{"message":"\u12e8\u12ed\u1208\u134d \u1243\u120d \u12f0\u130d\u121d \u12eb\u1235\u1308\u1261"},"sign_in":{"message":"\u130d\u1263"},"visit_this_site":{"message":"\u12ed\u1205\u1295 \u1323\u1262\u12eb \u130e\u1265\u129d"}}
